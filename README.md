- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Haavard-sigvartsen
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in stuff...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about alot of things
- This GitHub is mostly for project that i have made / copied and pasted by hand, that i can use for work case scenerioes, instead of finding one the internet in a hurry, only to barley understand it and cause a major error

I have experience in writting in:
  - Powershell
      - MS-BPAInfo4000 (Medium sized project) inspired by a colleague from ATEA at the time
      - DeleleFilesxDaysOld (Instead of remaking it from scratch every time, i just have it ready to go)

  - VB.net
      - CCS v3 (Large sized project for my fitness hobby), with some SQL in it, also my first project that gave me more motivation for programming.
